      "I stayed at this hotel for two nights while in New Haven. The hotel is very modern and clean with a very friendly staff. The hotel is located on Chape Street right next to the Yale campus and on a street with a number of good restaurants and coffee shops. I would recommend The Study if staying in New Haven.\n",
