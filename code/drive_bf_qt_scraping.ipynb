Check-in was very easy and even though this hotel is close to the highway and Ikea, there is a big patch of grass/bushes out front for dogs to relieve themselves --I didn\\'t see bags so bring your own. Yes, I agree with review that it is an older place but my room with one queen bed was plenty clean and comfortable. When I travel with my dog, the less fancy the better. :). Also, it made it nice that there was a dog friendly restaurant less than 10 minute drive away...see review for \"Basta\". I definitely feel good about spending just over $100 at this hotel which was just a stop along the way in my travels. Recommend to other dog owners. (P.s. This site says small pets only but that is not up to date. The policy attached on this site shows that they take any size).

This place was awesome!! We got to our \"suite\" and had to leave within 30 minutes to meet up with friends for dinner. We were driving from Michigan to Maine.

I am willing to pay extra to give the dogs extra space to move around after a long day in the car.', 'This hotel has a great location.
